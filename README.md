# watercycle

Watercycle is developing an open-source, low-cost water structuring device to improve crop yields and accelerate natural carbon sequestration.

We're just getting started and more documentation of the initial research will be posted soon.

## Design Inspiration
Below is a basic sketch of the geometry at the heart of the water structuring device:

* 2 cones with 60° angle
* each containing 5 golden ratio spirals
